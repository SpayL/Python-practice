#bbasically we need to study dict because we cannot implement real life data with list
# for implementing real time data we would need list into list which is not efficent
# dict is an unordered set of data

#syntax
data = {"name" :"payal","age" : 19}
#name and age is key
#payal and 19 are values
print(data)
 #method 2
data1 = dict(name= "payal", age=19)

print(data1)
print(type(data1))
